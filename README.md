## 👤 About Me  

✨ Outside of coding, I’m passionate about **sports and personal growth**. I’m currently training to run my first **marathon in October 2025**.  


🌍 Fun fact: I also run a **LEGO store** on Bricklink, which started as a hobby but became a fun way to learn about e-commerce and automation.
